# ImpGears

Little personal engine for 3D and image processing.

Current and future improvements of this project are oriented to enable the procedural generation of a large amount of pseudo-random textures and models. And with the able to do it by two ways :
- In real-time, using the GPU and shaders.
- By offline rendering, with the CPU only.

Key words : C++, OpenGL, pseudo-random, procedural, texture, image processing, 3D
